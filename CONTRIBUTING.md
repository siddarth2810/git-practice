# How to Contribute

Adding your profile is easy! Just follow these steps:

1. **Fork** this repository.
2. **Create a new JSON file** in the `participants` directory with your GitHub username as the filename (e.g., `your-username.json`).
3. **Add your information** to the file. Here's a template:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Your Full Name",
     "linkedin": "Your LinkedIn Profile URL",
     "github": "Your GitHub Profile URL"
   }
