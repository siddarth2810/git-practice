# Community Profiles

This repository allows our community members to share their LinkedIn and GitHub profiles. Add your profile as a JSON file in the `participants` directory to join!

## Adding Your Profile

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions on how to add your profile.

## Viewing Profiles

(You can mention here how profiles can be viewed, whether it's directly browsing the `participants` directory, or if you plan to compile them into the README or a separate document.)
